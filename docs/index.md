# REDCap External Module  Development Guide

This site is a guide to the development of software extensions to Vanderbilt University's Research Electronic Data CAPture (REDCap) using REDCap's External Module framework. Added to REDCap in the Fall of 2018, the external module framework has proven to be an effective an popular way to change REDCap's behavior to meet the needs of specific sites and projects. This guide provides an introduction to external modules and  guidance in creating a team and plan for developing modules for one's own needs and the larger REDCap community.

The audience for this guide is both REDCap Admins and software developers who would be writing the modules. The guide is split into a two sections to address the different audiences. The first section, [REDCap External Module Development for REDCap Admins and Developers](guide_for_admins_and_devs/), provides the background both audiences need to work together to create and share a module with the REDCap community. The second section, [REDCap External Module Development for Developers](guide_for_devs/), provides guidance to developers on how to write the module code, REDCap classes, and resources for module development. The developer's guide is primarily composed of a series of exercises to create simple modules that extend REDCap in different ways.
