# External Module Development Exercises

This directory contains test modules to use as a guide for module development. The majority of them are missing essential functionality, the regions where you need to introduce this functionality are cordoned off with comments.  
You should copy the contents of this directory to the `modules` directory or your REDCap container (or you may mount them as a volume).
