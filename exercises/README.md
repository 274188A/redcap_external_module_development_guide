# External Module Development Exercises

The External Module Development Guide includes a set of [development exercises](./) to use as a guide for module development. Each exercise teaches a different facet of module development. The majority of the exercises are missing essential functionality with comments denoting the regions where the functionality should be added.

## Preface
